Two custom themes:
* enso - two line theme with a null character. Shows 3 level pwd and current branch in git with status
* ddaypunk - v2 of enso with fun emoji for git status and such

Used: http://fsymbols.com/emoji/ to grab emojis

All others are from the https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh repo
